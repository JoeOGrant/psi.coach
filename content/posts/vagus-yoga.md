## SKY Yoga
Lindon recommends the mindful breathing practice Sudarshan Kriya (SKY) yoga as one approach to improving vagal tone. Research suggests this practice can have several potential benefits:

+ A 2013 review found that SKY yoga can have beneficial effects on heart rate, improve attention, and increase relaxation.
+ A small 2016 study found that this technique can decrease blood pressure.
+ A 2017 study found that SKY yoga may decrease depression and anxiety in people who don't respond to antidepressants.
+ A 2021 study found that this practice can improve sleep quality.
+ A typical SKY yoga session lasts for 45 minutes and consists of three breathing techniques performed at different paces. The final technique is known as "om" chanting.

To try it, sit in a comfortable upright position with your eyes gently closed, ideally on a mat or the floor with your legs crossed. Inhale, and then exhale on an "om" sound. According to Jacobs, this creates vibrations in the center of your body that can stimulate the vagus nerve.

You can also achieve a similar effect with a "voo" sound. Jacobs recommends trying to focus the vibration right behind your belly button, and pausing afterward to notice what sensations, thoughts, feelings, or images come up. Feel free to repeat this three times.
