## How Can I Tell if My Vagal Tone is Low?

Common signs of low vagal tone include feeling anxious and stressed; feeling wired but tired; and feeling overwhelmed with worry.

Here are three simple options to tests if your vagal tone is low and your nervous system is stuck in a sympathetic, fight or flight response:

### Nasal cycle test
1. Place your index finger directly underneath both nostrils.
2. Exhale through your nose strongly.
3. Determine whether your left (low vagal tone) or right (high vagal tone) nasal passage is active.

### Mindfulness check-in
Close your eyes and check in with yourself. How are you feeling? Calm and collected? Or wired but tired?

### Uvula deviation test
Open your mouth and say “ahhh” in the mirror, check for a deviation of your uvula – where the uvula, the fleshy bit at the back of your throat, leans to one side.
