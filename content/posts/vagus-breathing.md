## Box Breathing

When your fight or flight response kicks in, your body will respond by quickening your heart rate and breathing, Fedrick says. The idea behind box breathing is to take longer, deeper, and more intentional breaths, which signals your brain that you're safe. 

In fact, a small 2021 study found that just one 5-minute session of deep, slow breathing with an equal inhalation and exhalation helped promote a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity, ultimately reducing anxiety. 

To achieve this, Fedrick suggests trying box breathing. Here's how it works:

Start by gently exhaling all the air in your lungs.
Slowly breathe in as you count to four.
Hold your breath for a count of four.
Slowly exhale for another count of four.
Hold your breath again for a count of four, before starting the cycle all over again with an inhalation as you count to four.
Repeat three to five times. 

A 2019 review found that regulating breath through diaphragmatic breathing exercises can lower levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. One popular diaphragmatic breathing technique is known as the three-part breath.

## Triangle Breathing

While sitting tall or lying flat on your back, slowly start breathing in through your nose, allowing your belly to expand.
As you continue inhaling, allow the breath to move into your rib cage.
With the last stretch of your inhale, invite the breath into your upper chest.
Pause at the top, then slowly exhale â€” first from the chest, then from the rib cage, and finally from the belly.
Pause again before repeating this exercise 2-3 times.

## Bhramari (humming bee practice)

This practice helps to stimulate your vagus nerve and also increases the levels of nitric oxide (NO) released in the paranasal sinuses.

Inhale deeply through your nose.
Exhale and hum slowly and with a low resonance.
Keep your jaw relaxed and allow the hum sound to vibrate your mouth and jaw.
Try 10 rounds and see how you feel.

## Triangle Breathing with Chin Lock

Slow breathing combined with the chin lock help to stimulate your vagus nerve.

Inhale through both nostrils 1-2-3-4.
Close your nose and lock your chin to your chest for 1-2-3-4.
Lift your chin and exhale slowly 4-3-2-1.
Repeat for 10 rounds and see how you feel.
