## wtf are Solfeggio frequencies?

Whether you’re relatively new to soothing sounds or are a seasoned listener, the term ‘Solfeggio frequencies’ might be entirely new to you.

Solfeggio frequencies refer to specific tones of sound that help with and promote various aspects of body and mind health. These frequencies are reputed to date back to ancient history and said to be the fundamental sounds used in both Western Christianity and Eastern Indian religions, chanted by the Gregorian Monks and in ancient Indian Sanskrit chants.

Physician and researcher, Dr. Joseph Puleo, rediscovered Solfeggio frequencies in the 1970s, bringing their benefits back into public awareness. In his research, he used mathematical numeral reduction to identify six measurable tones that bring the body back into balance and aid in healing.

These Solfeggio frequencies were believed to profoundly affect the conscious and subconscious mind in order to stimulate healing and promote vitality. Thanks to Puleo’s work and the renewed interest, many scientists have since unearthed more evidence supporting the positive effects that these frequencies have on the human body.

## How to effectively utilize Solfeggio Frequencies

Moving to a quiet place away from any form of distraction: the silent place should be a place where you feel most welcome and free to express who you are. It can be a closet, bedroom, backyard, or an open field. In case you have a hectic life, for the elimination of distractions and noise, just try your best.

Ideally, find somewhere quiet where you won’t be disturbed and choose a tone that fits your needs. You can listen to your selected frequency either through headphones or just as background music.

Get a place that is comfortable enough for you to either lie down or sit. It can be a couch, bed, or a nice floor spot. Position yourself in a way that you find most comfortable. The style which works efficiently when meditating is the lotus position, but it is not a necessary sitting posture.

Select a suitable track that you will start with. The solfeggio frequencies do not have a particular order to be followed. You can start from the last; backward to the beginning. Add the frequencies to a playlist and play them through, ensuring your favorite frequencies are on repeat. You can set the playlist to a reshuffle for a random selection.

Set the frequencies at a volume you are comfortable with. The music sounds used for healing are best set at low to moderate volume as it is meant for relaxation. Every person will have a personal volume preference. It is advisable always to experiment so that you get the appropriate volume that works for you.

Relax yourself when listening. Healing music is best used for meditation or when trying to maintain focus and remain relaxed, for instance, when reading or working on a computer. Solfeggio frequencies are ideal at any time, including when you are asleep. The frequencies should never be listened to when performing tasks requiring your full attention.

Continue using the music as there are no pre-set time or magical time for listening to the healing 432 Hz frequencies. The music can be listened to for an entire day, some minutes, or for some few hours. There is a need for listening to solfeggio frequencies regularly. The benefits will, however, be noticed after some months.

## The science behind the Solfeggio frequencies
The scientific community began connecting the dots between the type of music played and the variety of physical effects on the human body. In 1988, biochemist Dr. Glen Rein made a discovery that confirmed what the ancient spiritual traditions understood when he tested the impact of different music on human DNA.

Rein exposed similar DNA vials to four kinds of music with different frequencies – Gregorian chants, Sanskrit chants, classical, and rock. By measuring the rate of UV light absorption, an essential function of healthy DNA, Rein was able to assess the effects of each type of music. And the results will make you reconsider the type of music you listen to when you want to relax.

The Gregorian and Sanskrit chants had the most positive, even healing, effects by increasing UV light absorption between 5 to 9 percent. The classical music increased UV absorption by small amounts. And rock music decreased UV light absorption, harming the DNA. Rein’s research supported the theory that sound frequencies do produce serious effects, for better or worse, on health and well-being.

Since Rein’s illuminating discovery, further research has come to light that shows Solfeggio frequencies have profound mental, emotional, and physical effects. Additionally, this understanding has led to music therapy becoming established as a health profession to help individuals therapeutically using various aspects of music creation and listening.

However, to understand what’s so special about the Solfeggio frequencies and how they differ from other tones, it’s first important to understand the Schumann resonance.

## Scientific tuning and the Schumann resonance
You might be wondering why it is that Solfeggio frequencies produce more positive effects on the body than any other sounds or tones. The answer lies in the Schumann resonance.

In 1952, German physicist Winfried Otto Schumann mathematically documented the electromagnetic resonances existing between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere—the electrically charged part of the Earth’s atmosphere. Schumann discovered that these electromagnetic waves, originating from discharges of lightening, resonated at a low frequency ranging between 7.86 Hz to 8 Hz. He determined that this frequency was, in essence, the Earth’s heartbeat. It has since been coined the Schumann resonance after its founder.

Schumann’s successor, doctoral candidate Herbert Konig, took this research a step further. He studied the connection between the Schumann resonances and found them to match various levels of human brain activity by comparing EEG recordings with the Earth’s electromagnetic fields.

Konig discovered that the resonances matched five different brainwave states: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. These are the brainwave states that occur naturally during all daily activities from sleeping to creating to learning.

Further research supports Konig’s findings that confirm the incredible similarities between the Schumann resonance and human brain activity. Additionally, other research shows that the low frequency of the Schumann resonance has been found to provide synchronization for higher brain function.

So, how do the Schumann resonances relate to Solfeggio frequencies?

The Solfeggio frequencies have such positive effects because they resonate in harmony with the Schumann resonance of 8 Hz. Musically speaking, the frequencies are derived by beginning at 8Hz and working up the musical scale octave by octave until the C note is vibrating at the 256 Hz frequency and the A note is vibrating at 432 Hz. When music is tuned to harmonize with this frequency it is known as scientific tuning.

The Solfeggio frequencies include, but are not limited to, six different tones. Let’s take a more in-depth look at each frequency and its unique healing effects on the body and mind.

## The benefits of the different Solfeggio frequencies
### 432 Hz

Many ancient musical instruments were constructed for 432 Hz tuning and before the mid-20th century, 432 Hz was the standard of instrumental tuning. Since then 440 Hz tuning has become the norm. The 432 Hz frequency resonates with the Schumann Resonance of 8 Hz and is known for its deeply calming and soothing effects.

A recent double-blind study from Italy showed that music tuned to 432 Hz slows down the heart rate when compared to 440 Hz. This frequency fills the mind with feelings of peace and well-being, making it the perfect accompaniment for yoga, gentle exercise, meditation, or sleep.

### 528 Hz

Even though the science on the reparative effects of the 528 Hz is still in its infancy, early research indicates that it has the ability to heal and repair the body.

A 2018 study from Japan discovered that music tuned to the frequency of 528 Hz significantly reduced stress in the endocrine systems and autonomic nervous systems—even after a mere five minutes of listening. And in a study published in the Journal of Addiction Research & Therapy, the frequency of 528 Hz reduced the toxic effects of ethanol, the principle ingredient found in alcoholic drinks, on cells. Even more astounding was that this frequency also increased cell life by about 20 percent.

The energizing and healing effects of music set to 528 Hz make it ideal background music any time you feel under the weather or simply need to unwind.

### 396 Hz

Music tuned to 396 Hz helps remove subconscious fears, worries, and anxiety. It also helps to eliminate feelings of guilt and subconscious negative beliefs blocking the path to achieving personal goals.

Listening to music tuned to this frequency is most helpful when you want to feel more uplifted, secure, and give power to your goals and dreams.

### 639 Hz

The frequency of 639 Hz helps balance emotions and elevate the mood. It also promotes communication, love, understanding, and brings harmony into interpersonal relationships.

Music set to 639 Hz is perfect when you need a significant boost of love and positivity or are dealing with conflicts in relationships.

### 741 Hz

Music tuned to the frequency of 741 Hz helps with problem-solving, cleansing the body, and self-expression. It also helps to awaken intuition and promote living simply and purely.

This frequency is ideal if you’re struggling with living a healthy lifestyle, expressing creativity, or speaking your truth.

### 852 Hz

The 852 Hz frequency helps to replace negative thoughts with positive ones, making it ideal when nervousness or anxiety is bringing you down. It also aids in awakening intuition and inner strength.

You’ll enjoy listening to music set to 852 Hz if you’re seeking to communicate with and live in harmony with your highest self.

Whether you prefer to have it as background music during daily activities or to accompany you while you sleep, each Solfeggio frequency has unique uplifting and soothing effects that you’ll undoubtably enjoy.
